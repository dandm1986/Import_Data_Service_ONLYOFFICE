# Service for importing data from external ONLYOFFICE spreadsheets

[ONLYOFFICE](https://www.onlyoffice.com/) doesn't have the possiblity of importing data from external spreadsheets (e.g. ImportRange in Google). This small web-service works together with a [plugin](https://github.com/dandm1986/Import_Data_Plugin_ONLYOFFICE) installed in a desktop ONLYOFFICE version.

`Endpoint` https://import-data-onlyoffice.herokuapp.com/api/v1/methods/import-range
