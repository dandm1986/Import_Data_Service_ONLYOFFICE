# Service for importing data from external ONLYOFFICE spreadsheets

[ONLYOFFICE](https://www.onlyoffice.com/) doesn't have the possiblity of importing data from external spreadsheets (e.g. ImportRange in Google). This small web-service works together with a [plugin](https://github.com/dandm1986/R7importRange) installed in a desktop ONLYOFFICE version.
